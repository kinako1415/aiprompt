# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Prompt Management System is designed to facilitate organizational AI adoption by providing a collaborative platform for sharing, managing, and improving AI prompts. The system addresses the challenge that prompt engineering presents to non-technical users by enabling teams to collectively build and refine high-quality prompts through a structured hierarchy and collaborative features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to manage organizational structure and user access, so that I can control who has access to our prompts and maintain organizational security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates an organization THEN the system SHALL create a new organization with the administrator as owner
2. WHEN an administrator invites users to an organization THEN the system SHALL send invitation emails and manage pending invitations
3. WHEN a user accepts an organization invitation THEN the system SHALL add them to the organization with appropriate permissions
4. IF a user is removed from an organization THEN the system SHALL revoke their access to all organization resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to organize prompts within projects under my organization, so that I can maintain logical groupings of related prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a project within an organization THEN the system SHALL create the project with proper organization association
2. WHEN a user views projects THEN the system SHALL display projects in a hierarchical structure (Organization > Project > Prompt)
3. WHEN a user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL archive all associated prompts and maintain data integrity
4. IF a user lacks project permissions THEN the system SHALL deny access to project resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a prompt creator, I want to create and manage prompts with comprehensive metadata, so that I can build effective AI instructions that are discoverable and reusable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a prompt THEN the system SHALL allow input of title, description, content, and tags
2. WHEN a user saves a prompt THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and store the prompt with timestamp and author information
3. WHEN a user adds tags to a prompt THEN the system SHALL support multiple tags for categorization and filtering
4. WHEN a user edits a prompt THEN the system SHALL create a new version while preserving the previous version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a prompt collaborator, I want version control for prompts, so that I can track changes, revert to previous versions, and understand the evolution of prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt is modified THEN the system SHALL automatically create a new version with incremental version numbering
2. WHEN a user views prompt history THEN the system SHALL display all versions with timestamps, authors, and change summaries
3. WHEN a user selects a previous version THEN the system SHALL allow restoration of that version as the current version
4. WHEN comparing versions THEN the system SHALL highlight differences between prompt versions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a prompt user, I want to search and filter prompts effectively, so that I can quickly find relevant prompts for my AI tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters search terms THEN the system SHALL search across prompt titles, descriptions, content, and tags
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL filter results by tags, authors, creation date, and project
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance and display key metadata
4. WHEN a user performs an empty search THEN the system SHALL display all accessible prompts with default sorting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a frequent prompt user, I want to favorite and rate prompts, so that I can quickly access useful prompts and help others discover quality content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the favorite button THEN the system SHALL add the prompt to their favorites list
2. WHEN a user views their favorites THEN the system SHALL display all favorited prompts with quick access
3. WHEN a user rates a prompt THEN the system SHALL record the rating and update the prompt's average rating
4. WHEN prompts are displayed THEN the system SHALL show average ratings and favorite counts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an AI tool user, I want to automatically input prompts into AI services, so that I can seamlessly use curated prompts without manual copying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Use with AI" THEN the system SHALL provide integration options for supported AI services
2. WHEN integrating with GPT services THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the prompt in the AI interface
3. WHEN using prompt integration THEN the system SHALL track usage statistics for analytics
4. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a prompt manager, I want to track editing history and user activity, so that I can maintain audit trails and understand prompt usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any prompt modification occurs THEN the system SHALL log the change with user, timestamp, and change description
2. WHEN a user views edit logs THEN the system SHALL display chronological activity with user attribution
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide usage analytics and activity summaries
4. WHEN accessing audit logs THEN the system SHALL restrict access based on user permissions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system user, I want secure authentication and authorization, so that I can safely access the platform and protect organizational prompt assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL require email verification and secure password creation
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials and establish secure session
3. WHEN accessing resources THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions for organizations, projects, and prompts
4. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for continued access

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want responsive access to the prompt management system, so that I can access and use prompts from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design that adapts to screen size
2. WHEN using touch interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly navigation and interaction elements
3. WHEN viewing prompts on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and functionality
4. WHEN performing actions on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and confirmation
